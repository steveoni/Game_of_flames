### How the game operate

let say your name is `Joe` and you want to fortell your relationship with `James`. the two name will be compared to each other. the common letter will be cancell out according to the number of time they appear. so `J` will be cancel out from both names like wise letter `e`. so it remain `o` in `Joe`, and `ams` in `James`. the remaining letter are join together it becomes `oams`, the total word is 4.

so count `flames` from `f` till you reached the value remained which is `4` and the letter in the `4th` is `m` which stand for `marriage`.

```js

var f = flames("joe",'james');

console.log(f);
//marriage
```
